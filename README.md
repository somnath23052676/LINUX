- creates a directory 

`cd directoryname` - changes directory to the specifid directory

`cd ..` - exits from the current directory \
**you can add more . after cd .. then one level more exit will be done , for example you are in /java/algorithms/sliding_windows , you want to go to /java then type cd ... , if you completely go back to home directory then cd ....**


`rm -r directoryname` - removes an non empty directory 

`ls` - lists directories and files 

`ls -l` - lists directories and files with more detail informations

`pwd` - shows current directory path 

`cp directory0/file directory1` - copies file from one directory to another directory

`mv directory0/file directory1` - moves file from one directory to another directory \
**the `mv` command can also be used in a different way , suppose in a directory a code is named as reverse_arr.java i want to rename the code file as reverse.java , then type `mv reverse_arr.java reverse.java`**

`cat array.java` - prints the contents of a file in text form in terminal
